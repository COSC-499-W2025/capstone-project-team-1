### Recap on this week's progress:
1. **Which features were yours in the project plan for this milestone?**  
   - I did not have any features in the plan for this milestone, as this is the first week of the project.  
   - I reviewed the project outline to understand the requirements and considered possible implementation approaches based on my knowledge and team discussions.  

2. **Which tasks from the project board are associated with these features?**  
   - I did not have any associated tasks, as this is the first week. 
   - Our goal was to complete the functional requirements, non-functional requirements, and work breakdown structure, which we achieved as a team by discussing ideas and agreeing on the best path forward.  

3. **Among these tasks, which have you completed/in progress in the last 2 weeks?**  
   - None, as this is the first week. The focus was on completing the requirements and work breakdown structure.  


### Reflection:  
Everyone in the group is eager to contribute to the project and willing to bring their thoughts to the table and have an open discussion. The workload seems fairly distributed as we lay the groundwork for our project such as setting the repo, project board and a discord channel

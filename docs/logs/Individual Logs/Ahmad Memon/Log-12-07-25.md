# Week 14 Log - Dec 1-7

## What I Did This Week

- Worked on **PR #225 (Theme-Styling)**: Added theme and styling components for the demo package including the `THEME` color palette, ASCII banner art, navigation hints, and status icons. Later addressed PR review comments by removing the unused `THEME` variable after confirming it wasn't being used in `components.py`.
- Worked on **PR #226 (Main-runner)**: Added the main demo runner with a modular `APIClient` class and simplified the demo.py entry point. Addressed PR review comments by implementing proper error handling—added `raise_for_status()` calls to all API client methods to prevent crashes when the server returns error responses (4xx/5xx).
- Reviewed a few PRs and provided feedback and requested changes when needed.
- Rebased branch 226 onto 225-Theme-Styling to ensure requirements align properly across the demo refactor PRs.
- Responsible for **team logs** this week—compiling and documenting the team's overall progress.

## Status of Last Week's To-Dos

- Polish the demo script with clearer flags/error handling – Completed; added `raise_for_status()` error handling to all API client methods in the 226-Main-runner branch.
- Hook the `/projects/timeline` endpoint and richer résumé/skill payload into the UI/TUI – Still pending; focused on the demo package refactoring this week.
- Jump back into the TUI selection pipeline – Not touched this week while I focused on the demo package modularization.

## Next Week's To-Dos

- For now – Resume work on the TUI selection pipeline and UI integration

## Reflection

This week was focused on code organization and addressing teammate feedback through PR reviews. Breaking the demo into a proper package structure (requirements → theme → components → API client → runner) should make it much easier for the team to maintain and extend. The error handling fix in the API client was a good catch from the PR review—it would have caused hard-to-debug crashes in production.

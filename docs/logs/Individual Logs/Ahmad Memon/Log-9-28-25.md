# Week 2 Log

This week I spent a good amount of time working on the system architecture diagram. In class, I sat with my team to sketch it out, and for me, it was helpful to see the whole picture come together. I also talked to a couple of other groups and asked the professors for feedback. Hearing their thoughts gave me more confidence that we are on the right track but also showed me where things could be improved.  

After , me and other team members held a meeting  and together we made some revisions to the diagram based on the professorâ€™s comments. Doing that actually cleared up several of my own doubts about how the system should be structured. Having a visual to work with really made things click for me.  

I also contributed to the project proposal this week. I helped write parts of the use case descriptions.

Overall, this week felt pretty productive for me. I came away with a much clearer understanding of the project and where I personally fit into it.

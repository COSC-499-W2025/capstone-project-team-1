# Week 1 Log

This week started off with a team meeting. Most of us managed to join, and we had a long chat about the **functional and non-functional requirements** of our project. It was actually nice to see how everyone brought different perspectives to the table.  

We also talked through how the system might be structured and what features we want to prioritize. On top of that, we got a sense of who’s comfortable with what tasks, which should make things smoother down the line.  

For me personally, it felt like a solid start. I got to share some of my ideas, listen to others, and just get a better understanding of where I fit in. I left the meeting feeling a bit more confident about the project.  

Outside of the meeting, I spent some time just reflecting on what we’re building and thinking about how I can contribute best. It feels good to be part of something that’s just starting to take shape. Overall, I’d say it was a **productive and motivating first week**.

# Week 15 Log - Jan 5-11

## What I Did This Week

- Worked on **Issue #259 / PR #260 (RepresentationPrefs)**: Implemented representation preferences API for Milestone 2 Task 23 (allow users to choose which information is represented). Created:
  - `RepresentationPreferences` Pydantic schema with `showcase_project_ids` and `project_order` fields
  - `RepresentationPrefs` SQLAlchemy model with SQLite persistence
  - GET/PUT `/views/{portfolio_id}/prefs` API endpoints
  - Alembic migration for the new table
  - 2 pytest tests for roundtrip and default value validation
- Addressed PR review feedback: Added Alembic migration and replaced deprecated `datetime.utcnow` with `datetime.now(UTC)`
- Reviewed Stavan's **PR #251** (multi-directory crawling) - provided feedback on missing migrations, typos, and type hint inconsistencies

## Status of Last Week's To-Dos

- Resume work on the TUI selection pipeline – Pivoted to Task 23 representation preferences work
- UI integration – Not touched this week

## Next Week's To-Dos

- Continue Milestone 2 work - build on representation preferences (apply prefs to portfolio views)
- Review and merge teammate PRs as needed

## Reflection

This week I focused on foundational work for user customization features. The representation preferences PR sets up the data layer so future PRs can simply read and apply the stored preferences. Kept the change small (~125 LOC) and followed existing codebase patterns. Also got more practice reviewing PRs and providing constructive feedback to teammates.

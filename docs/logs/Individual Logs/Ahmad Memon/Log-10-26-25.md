# Week 6 Log - Oct 20-26

## What I Did This Week

I finally stitched together a proper archive-inspection view. It steps through every folder and file in an uploaded zip so you can see the whole tree before we do anything with it. Right now it feeds on mock data, but once my teammate’s backend parser is ready I can swap in their payload and display the real results.

To keep everything from drifting, I added a new test case that exercises the archive view behavior and the supporting layout logic. It gave me a quick sanity check when I started tweaking the screen sizing.

After that I took another pass at the TUI layout. I nudged it toward a full-screen feel so the content has more breathing room. It still needs more polish, and a couple of the tweaks exposed rough edges elsewhere, so I’ve been poking around to make sure nothing major broke.

## Status of Last Week's To-Dos

- Hook the TUI upload flow into the AI integration pipeline - In progress (still leaning on mock data until my teammate finishes the backend endpoint)
- Parse uploaded zip files to pull the required project information - In progress (the archive view now surfaces the directory and file metadata as soon as the backend feeds it in)
- Store extracted data locally in the planned storage layer - Not started (holding off until the pipeline is wired up)

## Next Week's To-Do

1. Replace the mock zip listing with real data once the backend integration is ready.
2. Finish the full-screen layout adjustments and run full regression checks across the TUI.
3. Triage and fix any bugs introduced by the archive listing changes.

## Reflection

Seeing the archive listing play out in the TUI made the upload flow finally feel real, even if the data is still faked. That test case helped me catch a layout hiccup early, which made the full-screen experiment less stressful. Next week is going to be a mix of wiring in the live data coming from my teammate’s backend work and sanding down the UI so it feels intentional instead of hacked together.

# Week 3 Log

This week I focused heavily on creating the DFD for our system. I took the initiative to create the level 0 DFD myself, which helped me really understand the high-level flow of our entire system. Working through this on my own first gave me a solid foundation before collaborating with the team.

I also contributed my input to the level 1 DFD that we developed as a team. It was satisfying to see how my level 0 work connected to the more detailed breakdown we created together.

In class, we had the chance to look at other teams' DFD diagrams and share ours with them. I found this really helpful for my own understanding,seeing different approaches to similar problems gave me new perspectives on how we could structure our system.

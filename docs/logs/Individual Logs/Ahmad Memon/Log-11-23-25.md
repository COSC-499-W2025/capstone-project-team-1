# Week 11 Log - Nov 10-16 ( Reading Week )

## What I Did This Week

- Reading week, so I only had time for light work.
- Sketched the final checkbox layout for PR #172 and poked at a tiny prototype to make sure the scroll/selection plan still felt right.

## Status of Last Week's To-Dos

- File/folder selection in the TUI – Still in progress (design mostly locked, code waiting for after the break).
- Parse selected artifacts – Not started.
- Persist parsed output – Not started.

## Next Week's To-Dos

- Finish the checkbox UI and hook it to the upload flow.
- Start sending the chosen files into the backend pipeline.

## Reflection

Break week kept things short, but I’m ready to jump back into the backend tasks next week.

# Week 12 Log - Nov 17-23

## What I Did This Week

- Built the `/projects/timeline` API for PR #158 with filters for dates + active-only.
- Added seeded `RepoStat` rows plus a pydantic response model and tests so the endpoint stays stable.

## Status of Last Week's To-Dos

- TUI selection work – Paused while I focused on the backend deliverable.
- Parsing + persistence – Still on deck.

## Next Week's To-Dos

- Plug the new timeline endpoint into the UI.
- Swap the seeded stats with real repo intelligence output.
- Resume the TUI flow so selected files make it to the LLM prompts.

## Reflection

Happy the timeline API is live; now I just need to surface it in the app and get back to the file-selection loop.

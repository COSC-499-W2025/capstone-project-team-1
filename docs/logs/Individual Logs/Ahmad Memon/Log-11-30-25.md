  # Week 13 Log - Nov 24-30

  ## What I Did This Week

  - Closed Issue #211 / PR #215 by turning `demo.py` into a full end-to-end walkthrough (health check → consent → questionnaire →
  ZIP upload → OpenAI helper → repo analysis → summaries → résumé items → skill history/timelines → cleanup) so teammates can see
  the exact user flow.
  - While wiring the demo, fixed the backend data flow so repo stats persist before skills/resume generation, résumé items and
  skills arrive in the same payload, and the project ranking step can find repos hidden inside nested folders.
  - Expanded the reporting layer so the demo prints every résumé/skill row (instead of truncating tables) and shows the skill/
  timeline data the sponsor has been asking for.

  ## Status of Last Week's To-Dos

  - Plug the new timeline endpoint into the UI – Still pending; the timeline data now shows up in the demo output but hasn’t been
  threaded through the frontend yet.
  - Swap the seeded stats with real repo intelligence output – Partially addressed in the demo because it now pipes real repo
  stats/resume info, but the UI still expects the old seeded data.
  - Resume the TUI flow so selected files make it to the LLM prompts – Not touched this week while I focused on the end-to-end
  API demo.

  ## Next Week's To-Dos

  - Polish the demo script with clearer flags/error handling and document how to run it for the sponsor run-through.
  - Hook the `/projects/timeline` endpoint and the richer résumé/skill payload into the UI/TUI so everyone can reuse the backend
  work.
  - Jump back into the TUI selection pipeline so the uploaded ZIPs match what the LLM prompt builder consumes.

  ## Reflection

  Seeing the entire pipeline run in one script was a huge morale boost; now I just need to get those same improvements surfaced
  in the UI and the TUI flow so the rest of the team benefits from the integration work.

# Week 4 Log - Oct 6-12

## What I Did This Week

This week I started working on the actual implementation. I built a basic TUI (terminal user interface) with path persistence so the application remembers directory paths between sessions.

I also fixed linting issues, added test cases for the TUI, and cleaned up the repository by removing virtual environment files and updating .gitignore.

Made 7 commits total this week.

## Status of Last Week's To-Dos

- Review finalized requirements - Done
- Ensure documentation is in order - Done
- Create Kanban Board tasks - Done
- Begin coding - Done

## Next Week's To-Dos

1. Continue developing TUI features
2. Start integrating TUI with backend components
3. Write more tests
4. Review team members' pull requests
5. Update README with TUI documentation

## Reflection

Starting the coding felt good after weeks of planning. The TUI work was straightforward once I figured out the path persistence. Had to fix some linting issues but that helped me write cleaner code. Adding tests took longer than expected but it's worth it.

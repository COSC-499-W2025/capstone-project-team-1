# Week 5 Log - Oct 13-19

## What I Did This Week

We held a project sync on Discord to shape our next steps, align on how the README should evolve, and make sure everyone understands the direction of the deliverables. I also extended the TUI with an upload flow so users can navigate to an upload page and submit their zip files directly through the interface, then wrote tests so the new navigation and form logic stay covered.

## Status of Last Week's To-Dos

- Continue developing TUI features - In progress (built the zip upload navigation and form)
- Start integrating TUI with backend components - Not started
- Write more tests - Done (added coverage for the new upload navigation and form handling)
- Review team members' pull requests - Done this week
- Update README with TUI documentation - In progress (discussed structure during the Discord meeting)

## Next Week's To-Dos

1. Hook the TUI upload flow into the AI integration pipeline
2. Parse uploaded zip files to pull the required project information
3. Store extracted data locally in the planned storage layer

## Reflection

Laying out the README and project milestones with the team helped clarify priorities before diving deeper into implementation. Shipping the upload experience felt like a solid step forward for the TUI, and I'm motivated to connect it with the AI pipeline next so the feature delivers real value.

# Week 7 Log - Oct 27-Nov 2

## What I Did This Week

I finally got the TUI looking the same on every screen. The full-screen layout now feels uniform whether you’re uploading or browsing files.

I also chased down the freeze we kept seeing when jumping back from the directory view to the upload screen. Turning off the leftover async job fixed it.

Last thing was cleaning up the TUI folder. Each screen now lives in its own subfolder so the code is easier to follow with a more modular file structure. 

## Status of Last Week's To-Dos

- Replace the mock zip listing with real data once the backend integration is ready – Done (just had to switch the mock flag off)
- Finish the full-screen layout adjustments and run full regression checks across the TUI – Done
- Triage and fix any bugs introduced by the archive listing changes – Done

## Next Week's To-Do

- Waiting for the team meeting to sort out the next set of tasks.
- Probably having to do more bug fixes
- And implmenting the feature that would let the user further in the process of selecting their files.

## Reflection

This was a good cleanup week. The UI feels steadier, the freeze is gone, and the new folder layout already makes quick tweaks less of a headache. Looking forward to lining up the next steps once the team syncs.

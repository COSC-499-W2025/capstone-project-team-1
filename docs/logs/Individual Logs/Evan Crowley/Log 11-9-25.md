### Monday  
Had a group meeting and talked about what we wanted to get done this week.  
### Saturday  
Saturday I worked on creating the structure for AI integration into the git repository process. Basically I just wanted to use an LLM for a summary of the users' contributions. I ended up adding the full structure for running an analysis with an AI, but lacked an API key to properly test it. I ended up also making a method for analyzing a user's contributions by just using gitpython.   
### Sunday  
Added some more tests, Created a log, added some comments to my code, and reviewed a PR.   
### Worked on this week:

- Git repository intelligence using git python  
- Created repo-intelligence-AI.py and repo-intelligence-user.py modules   
- Created a basic fallback for non-LLM users  
- created user allows llm() function to check the database to see if the user has allowed the use of a LLM  
- created extract added lines() to filter commits to only be the users additions  
- created tests for the users consent to use LLM, and user repo stat retrieval

### Reflection:  
This week I worked on setting up functions for creating an AI summary of a user's additions, and a non AI summary for the case where a user does not want to use an LLM.  
 
### Team Dynamic:   
This week our group did pretty good. I saw a lot of good additions, and a lot of group members worked with me to help and get my tasks done.

### Plan:  
I plan to look into a local LLM option for users who don't have an API key. I was wanting to look into Ollama and how that works.

### Monday  
Met with the team, and went over the requirements slides and started discussing what the project will look like. Got a good idea of the group dynamic and the group members.  
### Tuesday  
Got together as a group and completed the project requirements for the class discussion. I printed off two copies at home to bring for the discussion on Wednesday.  
### Wednesday  
We talked through our requirements to other groups, and heard their requirements as well. We clarified what others said for functional and non-functional requirements.

### Worked on this week:

- Project requirements  
- Clarifying group tasks  
- Team meetings and discussions  
- Setting up the repo

### Reflection:  
This week is mostly just setup. Added to the github file structure, but besides that not a lot of technical work yet, just laying the groundwork.

### Team Dynamic:  
Everyone participated in the process that was able to attend. The workload so far seems pretty evenly distributed.

### From Peer Review
![Tasks_I_Did](Tasks%20SeptOct29-5.png)

### Monday
We worked on our DFD level 0 and made a quick DFD level 1 that expanded on the process. The DFD was general and a good base to work off of.
### Wednesday
We shared our DFD with other groups. It was made clear that we needed to expand our diagram, so we expanded the DFD level 1 to be clearer and more detailed.

### Worked on this week:
- Created DFD level 0 and 1
- Improved DFD level 1
- Worked on general group tasks

### Reflection:
Our original DFD level 1, didn't have enough information, and was too broad. We changed it to be more specific, and so that it was clearer what we intend to have for our project. Overall the DFD level one looks better now and it's clear what we want to have.
### Team Dynamic:
Everyone worked on the DFD this week, everyone that could attend helped to expand the DFD. The workload so far seems again pretty evenly distributed.

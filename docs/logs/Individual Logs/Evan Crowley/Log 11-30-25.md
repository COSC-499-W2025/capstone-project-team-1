### Saturday 
Made requested changes to my PR and merged it with development

### Worked on this week:

- Analysis endpoint, for milestone one completion
- Documentation of my code for easier integration of milestone 1
- presentation preperations like slides, and notes


### Reflection:  
Worked hard this week to be ready for the milestone. I think that I completed my part in a timely manner and was helpful 

### Team Dynamic:   
Was good this week, everyone tried to complete their part
### Plan:  
I plan on working on the presentation video, the team contract and other milestone related work before the end of the semester.

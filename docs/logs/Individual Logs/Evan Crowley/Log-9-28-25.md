### Monday  
Met with the team, talked over the plan and made a diagram in Excalidraw.   
### Wednesday  
Got together as a group and shared our diagram to the class ended up getting some good feedback, and saw some well planned out diagrams. It was made clear that we needed to make some changes to our diagram and that we would finalize it Saturday.  
### Saturday  
I joined the group discussion over discord and we discussed some improvements to our diagram. I ended up typing out the *Project Scope and usage Scenario* for the project proposal and the first and second use cases.

### Worked on this week:

- Project proposal  
- Clarifying group tasks  
- Project diagram

### Reflection:  
This week we continued to prepare and plan the project, creating diagrams and frameworks. I feel that we know what direction we want to take the project and have more of an idea now how were going to accomplish it.

### Team Dynamic:  
Everyone participated in the process that was able to attend. The workload so far seems again pretty evenly distributed and well balanced.

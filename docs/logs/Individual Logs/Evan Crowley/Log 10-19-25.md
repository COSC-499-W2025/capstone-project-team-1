### Monday  
No class Thanksgiving
### Wednesday  
In-Class quiz

### Saturday  
We got in a call and had a discussion for the week, determined what we wanted to get done by sunday.

### Sunday  
I worked on some coding, added some functions related to git like one that simply runs git commands. Then I used that function to count the amount of commits done to a local repo specified by the user. I also added some tests.

### Worked on this week:

- Added function "isGitRepo()" to check if a git repository exists inside of a sepecified path
- Added a function "runGit()" to run a git command with specified arguements inside of a sepecified directory
- Added a function to get the count of the author commits for a git directory using a combination of "runGit()" and "isGitRepo()"
- Created tests for "isGitRepo()" function

### Reflection:  
 There was no class on Monday, had more midterms that complicated development, as well as the quiz for this class. Overall I feel a lot got done, all things cosidered.

### Plan:  
I plan to continue my development next week, I want to add more git related functions to continue the project.

### Monday  
Had a group meeting and discussed what we needed to get done before milestone #1 
### Saturday  
First I made sure that the LLM integration was working by setting up my API key, and then creating new tests to ensure everything was working correctly. I worked on creating a method to see what kind of additions users make in their commits in git repos, called activity classifier. 
### Sunday  
I made a fiew more tests, reviewed some PRs and made sure that my code was working correctly before making my own PR.   
### Worked on this week:

- Git repository intelligence LLM integration
- Tests for LLM call and activity classification
-  Integrated activity classifier into get repo stats, so that it will be run and saved with all of the users info

### Reflection:  
This week I worked on making sure that the LLM was working correctly so that it was giving accurate summaries. I Made additions to tests and ensured that no new errors were generated. I then made a method for classifying activity types, and made tests to ensure that worked.
 
### Team Dynamic:   
This week our group did good. Everyone seemed to do really good and picked up any neccessary tasks so that were ready for monday.

### Plan:  
I plan to pick up some issues this week from the board, and make sure that I and everyone else on the team is ready for monday presentations.

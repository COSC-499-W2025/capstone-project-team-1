### Monday
Got together and worked on a schedule for the week. We decided to get together on Saturday to discuss future work before the next milestone.


### Saturday
We had a group meeting where we decided on what should be done before the milestone. Split up work evenly among the group members that could make it. I worked on getting async openAI calls working.


### Sunday
Managed to get the async calls working and created some tests. Made a log for this week.


### Worked on this week:
- Added the ability to use OpenAI asynchronously. This allows the user to make multiple calls at once, and not having to wait for the last completed call
- Added tests to show the efficiency of synchronous vs asynchronous calls.




### Reflection:
This week I was able to add Asynchronous calling for openAI. It was fairly easy to add and it generally should speed up the calls, as more can be done at once.


### Team Dynamic:
This week was good, most people in the team were there for the meeting, adn everyone was able to help each other when needed.
### Plan
For next week I want to work on further file analysis. I want to deepen the analysis of files not included in repositories and make sure that there is working AI and non-AI analysis for the peer review and milestone.

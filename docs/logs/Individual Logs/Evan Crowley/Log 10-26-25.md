### Monday  
Discussed our project progress, and what we were planning on working on this week.
### Wednesday  
No class
### Thursday  
I began development on mySQLite after we determined that we needed a basic database. I made a basic SQLite database instead of working more on the repository intelligence. I looked into GitPython like I said, and I still want to implement that.  
### Saturday  
Continued working on the SQLite added a test to verify db connection.   

### Sunday  
Reviewed a branch, and created my log for today.

### Worked on this week:

- Created basic SQLite db  
- Made a basic db connection test  
- Reviewed a branch

### Reflection:  
 Overall this week was productive, got the sql db in there, and managed to review a branch. I would have liked to have done more, but got held up with other assignments.

### Plan:  
Next week I definitely want to work on implementing GitPython. I also want to continue adding tests, and reviewing code.

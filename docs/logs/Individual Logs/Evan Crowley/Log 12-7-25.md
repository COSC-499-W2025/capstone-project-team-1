### From Peer Review
![Tasks_I_Did](Tasks%20Dec1-7.png)


### Monday
Completed milestone presentation. Did multiple peer reviews of other groups as they presented.
### Saturday
Worked on a repository health checker. The goal was to be able to rate a repository based on if it has certain files, this would indicate how well it was maintained. It would also survey for when the last commit was made.
### Sunday
Finalized the repository health checker, and added some testing. Made some PR reviews.


### Worked on this week:


- Created the repository health checker method
- Integrated the repository health checker into the get repo stats method
- Made some PR reviews




### Reflection:  
The last week of the semester so it was fairly chaotic. That being said, lots still got done and there is always progress to be made. I think that for this week I'm happy with the additions I made and that I'm looking forward to next semester.


### Team Dynamic:
This week the team did well in the presentation and we all attended. Everyone got a lot done this week and as always I appreciate the diligent work of my team members.


### Plan for next week
I plan on continuing my work throughout the break, and seeing what I can get accomplished in that time. If any PRs are made I hope to make at least one review.

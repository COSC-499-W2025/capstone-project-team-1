### Monday
Got together as a team and determined what we wanted to get started on this semester. Got a rough plan down for when we wanted to meet next.


### Friday
Got together over discord and made a plan for what we wanted to have done by Sunday.


### Saturday
Worked on integrating Ollama into the AI processing method. Basically having Ollama as an option to replace ChatGPT requires no API key.


### Worked on this week:
- Added the ability to use Ollama instead of chatGPT
- Changed necessary methods so that Ollama can be chosen if that is the users selected AI model
- Created tests for Ollama AI analysis, similar to the chatGPT analysis


### Reflection:
This week I was able to add basic Ollama integration. Having the ability to choose between a fully local model and one online I think will not only add security but allow the program to be used by those who do not have an API key for chatGPT.


### Team Dynamic:
We determined what needed to be done on Friday. Overall I think that those who were given a task were able to complete it in a timely manner.


### Plan
For next week I want to work on the AI analysis more and determine what model will be best to be run locally through Ollama. I would also like to work on the output and see what can be done for outputting helpful user information.

### Monday
Got together and worked on a schedule for the week. We decided to get together on Saturday to discuss future work before the next milestone.


### Saturday
We had a group meeting where we decided on what should be done before the milestone. Split up work evenly among the group members that could make it. I worked on getting async openAI calls working.


### Sunday
Managed to get the async calls working and created some tests. Made a log for this week.


### Worked on this week:
- Added the ability to use OpenAI asynchronously. This allows the user to make multiple calls at once, and not having to wait for the last completed call
- Added tests to show the efficiency of synchronous vs asynchronous calls.




### Reflection:
This week I was able to add Asynchronous calling for openAI. It was fairly easy to add and it generally should speed up the calls, as more can be done at once.


### Team Dynamic:
This week was good, most people in the team were there for the meeting, adn everyone was able to help each other when needed.
### Plan
For next week I want to work on further file analysis. I want to deepen the analysis of files not included in repositories and make sure that there is working AI and non-AI analysis for the peer review and milestone.

### Monday
Got together as a group and determined we needed to get the APIs solved and a CLI together. Nathan and I decided to work on the CLI together.

### Thursday
Got together with Natahan and created a non-interactive CLI. 


### Sunday
Determined what we wanted to mention during the peer review.


### Worked on this week:
- non-interactive CLI was created
- made tests for the non-interactive CLI


### Reflection:
Got the CLI working this week. It was determined that that should take top priority in order to be ready for the peer review.


### Team Dynamic:
Good, we worked together this week to make sure everyone was ready for the peer review.

### Plan:
Continue to work on file analysis outside of repositories. I want to make sure that full file analysis is ready before the next milestone.

### Wednesday  
We got together as a group and worked out the details on what we needed to get done that week, and decided to get together in a call on Thursday.

### Thursday  
We talked on a call to determine how we were going to split up the work. We decided that once we updated the WBS we would have a good idea of who should do what.

### Saturday  
I worked on the README file and the Kanban board making sure there were tasks to be done for Sunday.  Created the development branch and set up the environment for development. 

### Sunday  
I worked on coding my first bit of the project. Made a class to organize the git projects, ended up making two tests for the class. Finished the README, updated with explanations for both DFD and System Architecture diagrams.

### Worked on this week:

- Added System Architecture diagram with explanation to README  
- Added DFD with explanation to README  
- Added Updated WBS to README  
- Created a new class for git organization  
- Created new tests for the new Class

### Reflection:  
 There was no class on Monday, and some midterms, and assignments, so I am satisfied with the amount of work I got done.

### Plan:  
I plan to continue my development next week of the git reader, and expand my testing. Hopefully there will be some code for me to review next week as well.

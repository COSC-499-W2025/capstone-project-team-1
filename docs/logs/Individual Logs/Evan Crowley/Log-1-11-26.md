### Monday
Got together as a team and determined what we wanted to get started on this semester. Got a rough plan down for when we wanted to meet next.


### Friday
Got together over discord and made a plan for what we wanted to have done by Sunday.


### Saturday
Worked on integrating Ollama into the AI processing method. Basically having Ollama as an option to replace ChatGPT requires no API key.


### Worked on this week:
- Added the ability to use Ollama instead of chatGPT
- Changed necessary methods so that Ollama can be chosen if that is the users selected AI model
- Created tests for Ollama AI analysis, similar to the chatGPT analysis


### Reflection:
This week I was able to add basic Ollama integration. Having the ability to choose between a fully local model and one online I think will not only add security but allow the program to be used by those who do not have an API key for chatGPT.


### Team Dynamic:
We determined what needed to be done on Friday. Overall I think that those who were given a task were able to complete it in a timely manner.


### Plan
For next week I want to work on the AI analysis more and determine what model will be best to be run locally through Ollama. I would also like to work on the output and see what can be done for outputting helpful user information.

### From Peer Review
![Tasks_I_Did](Tasks%20OCTNov20-2.png)

### Monday  
Had a group meeting and agreed on what we wanted to get done for this week.
### Wednesday  
Worked on Git Repository Intelligence, used git python. Added the ability to save repo stats onto the database. 
### Thursday  
Continued work on saving the specific languages used in git repositories. Created lists to store all used languages in local git repos and the percentage those languages takes up.
### Sunday  
Updated the comments for clarity, fixed a test so that it would run on anyone's computer using relative paths.

### Worked on this week:

- Git Repository Intelligence using GitPython
- Made it so that the repo info can be saved to the database as a table
- Added a list for storing languages from most to least common and the percentage of those languages
- Added a basic check for if a repository is collaborative or not


### Reflection:  
 This week I worked on saving and creating repo information. I feel development was good this week, I got quite a few important additions crossed off the list. 

### Team Dynamic: 
This week our group did pretty good, and everyone tried to complete tasks in a timely manner. I think that we accomplished a lot as a team this week.


### Plan:  
I plan on adding a more comprehensive way of checking if a local repo is collaborative or not next week. I also plan to continue writing tests, and checking my teammates' code.

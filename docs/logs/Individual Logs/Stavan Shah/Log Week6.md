# Logs - Week 6

- I helped the team decide on the 6 microservices we will be implementing for our project.
- Then we assigned primary owners for each microservice and I volunteered to be the primary owner for the API part of the project which we will implement in FastAPI.
- Then based on the ownership of each microservice, I updated the WBS and added it to our shared google drive where evan will eventually update the README file with it.
- Helped deciding the folder structure of our project based on the 6 micoroservices and how we will be organizing our code.

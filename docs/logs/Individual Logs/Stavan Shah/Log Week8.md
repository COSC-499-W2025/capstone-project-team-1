# Logs - Week 7

* This week, I focused on creating an api endpoint in FastAPI that gets pre seeded user configuration questions from our SQLite Database.
* Then I integrated that questions endpoint to the TUI and wrote TUI code so that our user can answer to those questions. 
* Database gets seeded with user questions on api startup. 
* Created a questions table in our sqlite database to store those questions.

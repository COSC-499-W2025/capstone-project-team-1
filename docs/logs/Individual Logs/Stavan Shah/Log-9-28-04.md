# Logs - Week 5  Sept 29 - Oct 5

- We made our initial Level 0 and Level 1 Data Flow Diagrams in Monday Class. 
- Realized we made it too simple when we compared it to other groups in Wednesday class. 
- Helped and collaborated with team members to appropriately add more processes and data stores to the DFDs.
- Cross checked the DFDs with our project requirements and system architecture to ensure everything was consistent.


# Reflection:

I feel like this week I got a good sense of how our project will work and how it will look like. 
Looking forward to next week where we will finalze our project requirements, system architecture and work allocation and working together to make our project a reality as a team.

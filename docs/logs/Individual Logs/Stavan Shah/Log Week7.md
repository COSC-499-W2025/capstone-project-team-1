# Logs - Week 7

* This week, I focused on setting up the initial structure for our API microservice using FastAPI. I created the basic project layout and implemented a simple endpoint to ensure everything is functioning correctly.

* Created a health-check endpoint that return the status of server and server time. Also added pydantic models of the same in models.py file.

* Created folder structure for the API microservices and reviewed PR's for OpenAI helpers.

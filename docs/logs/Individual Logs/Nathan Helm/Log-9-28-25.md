<h1>PERSONAL LOG-- 28/09/2025</h1>
* This week, we discussed the project requirements for our Digital Artifact Mining Application.
<h3> Schedule</h3>

- Monday: Using the note software textural, we designed a software architecture diagram. This was a collaberative process in which our team had to ideate and challenge opinion to create a software diagram that will handle the "ebbs and flows" of our project. 

- Wednesday: We improved our diagram. This week I discussed about certain features that should be added or scrapped considering the constraints of skill level and project scale. This resulted removing features such as a local database but we added features such as calling to a cloud llm.This, by consequence, made our diagram have a higher fidelity. 

- Sunday: We began by working our project proposal. I was responsible for the software solution but my contributions go beyond that. I also reviewed and had helpful contributions in our final version of the system archtecture diagram. 

**Reflection:**

This week was very productive. I was impressed with our whole team and that we were able to communicate times despite time conflicts among memebers. I am proud of my contributions especially my value statement, due to how simple it must be, I think it sums our project very well.

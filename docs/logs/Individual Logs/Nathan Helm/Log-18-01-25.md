**Duties & Hyperlinks**

This week I was responsible for multiple tasks...

# Coding Tasks

This first task I was asked to do was to build a user email api request, allowing a user to easily add user configurations such as email, answer date, ect.
This would allow for a more streamlined application, users can easily get and post information using an api request with little effort.
It will also be useful for peer testing evaluation as we begin to build the TUI front end. The TUI will eventually require these calls:

I also began work on updating my crawler, I started to integrate blacklisting to determine what file formats should be included and excluded

# Testing Tasks

This is the test I made, it tests post, get, and method user_email_to_db, They all pass

**Reflection & Team Dynamic**

I am very proud of our team and the way we collaborate. I believe we are very responsive with our pull requests, which makes our workflow smooth and efficient. I am also excited about my current task, and I feel that I have a strong grasp of my responsibilities at this point.

**Next Week** 

This upcoming week, I am going to work with Evan's Ollma code. He needs to use my crawler code so I'll have to communicate with him on that part.

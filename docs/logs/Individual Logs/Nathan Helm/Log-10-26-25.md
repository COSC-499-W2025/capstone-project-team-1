<h1>PERSONAL LOG-- 5/10/2025</h1>
* This week I focused enhancing my crawler system and did the team log, and reviewed pr requests from others.

<h3> Schedule </h3>
- Friday: Group discussion regarding our weekly tasks.

- Saturday and Sunday 
continued programming tasks and began work on team logs. This included documenting progress across all members and adding serveral sub systems to my original crawler.

<h3> Reflection Team Dynamic </h3>

Once again, I am pleased with everyones contributions, including my own. I feel the weekly meetups makes everyone sure they know what is expected of them.

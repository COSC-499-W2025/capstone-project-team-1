<h1>PERSONAL LOG-- 19/10/2025</h1>
* This week. we worked on foundations of our capstone project. 
<h3> Schedule</h3>

- Monday: no class thankgiving

- Wednesday: quiz, had little time to discuss our project with group members.

- Saturday: we had a metting which focused primarily on the folder structure of our code and making sure everyone knows their given responsibilites. I also made revisions and made productive comments to teamates pushing to the development branch. Lastly, I made some small progress in my code but it still needs a lot more work. 

**Reflection & Team Dynamic**

I was unfortunately very busy this week to there wasn't too much I contributed. I did however handle many test making that pr we well tested and purposeful. Our team is doing really well I'm happy that everyone is working on their tasks and communicating on discord.

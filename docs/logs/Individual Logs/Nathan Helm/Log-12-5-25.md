<h1>PERSONAL LOG-- 12/10/2025</h1>
* This week. we worked on foundations of our capstone project. 
<h3> Schedule</h3>

- Monday: no class

- Wednsday: Our group worked on our WSB, which documented our tasks for each person in the group. We also had a general discussion about our previous build diagrams.

- Friday: Our team hopped on a call. Our goal was primarily to choose our task responsabilities. I chose task 3 which has me in charge of directory "crawler" duties. I would follow with this on sunday...

- Sunday: We became aware that boilerplate code was needed for our project. I began building the fundamentals of our tasks. I started on the folder crawler, which would allow us to traverse directories and collect relevant file paths for collecting and later LLM use. I ran pytests as well to ensure code quality, even if its still early stage.

**Reflection & Team Dynamic**

I am very proud of our team. I believe we are very responsive with out pull requests. I also I am excited with my task. I think currently I have a strong grasp on what I am responsible for.

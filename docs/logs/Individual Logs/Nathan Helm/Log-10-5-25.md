<h1>PERSONAL LOG-- 5/10/2025</h1>
* This week I focused on data flow diagrams, a visual representation of how data MOVES through a system. 

<h3> Schedule </h3>
- Monday: Discussed advancments and finalized the system architecture diagram. 

- Wednesday: Wednedsay was when we began our data flow diagram and its 2 levels. Our focus was the display how data moved between the user and our system. This data "movement" became for apparent when working on the data flow diagram level 1. It also became clear that our LLM system was more complex than we thought which prompted many discussions and a few disagreements. However, in the end, I believe our data flow diagram clearly shows the traversal of data in our system. I believe we are nearing the end of the design for our system. 

<h3> Reflection Team Dynamic </h3>

Once again, I am pleased with everyones contributions, including my own. My contributions where (but not limited to) reviewing providing feedback, adding to the sketch, and making sure everyone was on the same page. I also thought communicating to others why data is traversed in the manner that it is forced my teammates to think constructively.

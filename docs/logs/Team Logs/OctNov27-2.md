# Capstone Team 1 Log, Oct 27- Nov 2

## Work Perfomed
This week the team made more progress on the application as we get closer to Milestone 1. We now have a user flow from the start to be able to upload the zip file that they want to be used to create their resume

## Milestone Goals
- Zip upload → browse files end‑to‑end with a new screen.
- User config and consent stored in DB and validated.
- TUI fixes for a smooth demo path

## Reflection
Good week. We got zip → file browsing working, worked on the  user config/consent, and started saving user preferences to the DB. There are a few UI bugs to squash but overall the team is making great progress.

## Work Performed
CLI Development & API Cleanup

## Reflection
This week we built a full command-line interface for our application. Evan created the basic CLI with input/output handling, email, and consent options (#299), and Stavan extended it with interactive mode that prompts for missing arguments and confirms before overwriting (#301). We also fixed a critical timestamp bug where the datetime module was being assigned instead of an actual datetime value, and standardized all datetime handling to use naive UTC datetimes for SQLite compatibility (#304). Evan added lazy initialization for the OpenAI client so it's only created when needed (#295), and Nathan connected CLI functions to API endpoints for data consistency (#306). Ahmad enhanced the interactive CLI with repo selection and timeline view (#308). We also merged several individual logs and the dev branch into main.

## Plan for next week
We will focus on AI integration—both local LLMs (Ollama) and OpenAI. We'll also explore integrating OpenTUI into our codebase and may close the Textual-based TUI issues (#268-272) if we proceed with OpenTUI.

# Capstone Team 1 Log, Oct 5-12

## What We've Done This Week

This week we transitioned from planning to actual development. Ahmad worked on building the TUI (Terminal User Interface) with basic path persistence and added tests for it. Evan set up the development branch and created the RepoStats class along with the main repo intelligence module. Shlok integrated OpenAI's API with a helper class and wrote tests for it.

We also updated our README with the revised System Architecture diagram, DFD Level 1, and WBS based on the feedback we received on our proposal. Everyone completed their individual logs, and we merged several PRs including the documentation updates and individual log submissions.

## Status Update on Last Week's To-Dos

|------|--------|-------|

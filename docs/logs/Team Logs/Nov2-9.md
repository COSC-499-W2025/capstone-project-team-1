# Capstone Team 1 Log, Oct 27- Nov 2

## Work Perfomed
As a team, we now made the TUI fullscreen, something that we struggled to do since the beginning of the project. We also stopped using mocks in the TUI and started to wire the TUI with the API layer for zip uploads and zip file extraction. Additonally we are now storing specifics of git repos into our database and have added an openai route to get llm analysis as defined by user consent. 
We have made great progress this week and will be working during the reading break to add more features

## Milestone Goals
* Extrapolated individual contributions for a given collaboration project
* Extracted key project metrics for a project.
* Stored individual contributions and project metrics in the database.
* Fixed a critical bug on development, added ZIP endpoints and file include exclude functionality.

## Reflection
This week was very productive. We made the TUI fullscreen, connected it to the API, and added database storage for repo data and user preferences. The OpenAI route for LLM analysis is now in place, and next week the team will focus on expanding git analysis and non-LLM analysis features. Overall, steady progress and strong teamwork continue to drive the project forward.
